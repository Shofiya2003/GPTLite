# GPTLite
A nano transformer model
I used [Attention Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) and Andrej Karpathy's videos to build a small GPT-inspired model from scratch and trained it on the Shakespeare dataset.

# To Do
- [ ] Use `tiktoken` to encode the data.  
- [ ] Increase the hyperparameter values and train the model (when I am not GPU-scarce).
